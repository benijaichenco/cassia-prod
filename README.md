Cassia -
My first fullstack app.

Cassia is a space to explore the world of fragrances.

It's a journal where scents and stories come together, offering inspiration and insight for those who love the art of perfumery.

Whether it's a note that sparks a memory or a fragrance that captures a mood, I hope you find something here that resonates with you.
